Making the printer was pretty fun, but after printing a few calibration cubes to reassure myself, it sort of sat around for a bit. I printed a couple of guitar picks for friends, but those are flat, easy prints.

After finishing the calibration cube, for the first time ever I had access to a 3D printer. All I had ever seen prior was the glamorous, perfectly calibrated and gorgeous models the online 3D printing hype tries to advertise, so printing failures this time 'round taught me a few things.

I found out as I started printing a larger variety of items that different types of objects might require attention and tweaking. Another thing I learned is how much of a difference the fan makes. It really makes a difference in terms of precision. I was printing some parts for a 3D printed version of the [MeArm][mearm-hackaday], 

and the parts I printed without the fan were not very usable. Without the fan blowing the filament didn't dry quickly enough as it was laid down, so the holes for screws and joints weren't big enough. Filament would droop into them during the print. I'm not sure how clearly you can see the difference in thise pictures, but here's a piece printed without the fan on (left) and one with the fan on (right):
