<h2 class="section-heading">About Me</h2>
<p>I am a lowly electrical engineering undergraduate at the University of British Columbia, soon to graduate. I am currently searching for work after graduation in May 2018. I have done about a year and a half of co-op in the software industry, and am currently doing another internship in full stack web development this summer.</p>

This page was created with Jekyll, Github pages, Ruby, and Bootstrap. It is version 2.0 of an older blog I used to have, and which I hope you haven't seen. I guess I didn't know any better then, forgive me if your eyes fell prey... that one was served off of Heroku and didn't really have proper blog logic implemented. I'd like to give a short thanks to Jekyll for being so awesome. Setting it up on Windows was a bit hairy, but other than that, fantastic. Hooray for static blogs!

<p>Special credit to the wavy water colour at the top left of the page header. This graphic was designed by <a href="http://www.freepik.com/free-photos-vectors/background">Freepik</a>, I simply edited the bottom bit so it'd fit nice into the corner of the site banner.</p>
